Gerry’s classes are open hearted and creative with an opportunity to focus on the breath and open the body in a gentle and playful way.

She encourages correcting skeletal alignment, and using yoga to make the body more mobile for use in everyday movement.

> I have practiced with Gerry for almost 10 years, her teaching is intuitive and embodied, infused with so much depth of understanding and delight in yoga. I feel inspired and refreshed after every class.

> As an instructor, Gerry perfectly balances a rigorous practice with gentle self-awareness. Her flow classes are creatively choreographed, so that more challenging poses are easier to embrace and it's possible to go deeper into them. I can't recommend her enough!.
