Gerryâ€™s classes are open hearted and creative with an opportunity to focus on the breath and open the body in a gentle and playful way.

She encourages correcting skeletal alignment, and using yoga to make the body more mobile for use in everyday movement.

> "I *have practiced with Gerry for over 10 years, her teaching is intuitive and embodied, infused with so much depth of understanding and delight in yoga. I feel inspired and refreshed after* every class"

> *"As an instructor, Gerry perfectly balances a rigorous practice with gentle self-awareness. Her classes are creatively choreographed, so that more challenging poses are easier to embrace and it's possible to go deeper into them. I can't recommend her enough!"*  Lara Eggleton, writer, editor and consultant
