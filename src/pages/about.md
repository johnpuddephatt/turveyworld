Gerry’s work challenges notions of physicality: sensitively designing temporary alliances to the surroundings.

She uses juxtaposition of bodies in different spaces to create unfamiliar presence in familiar surroundings.

The work of Turvey World Dance mediates relationships between body as site and the body in sites, to frame place, time and location.

Gerry has contributed to projects in many parts of the world. This has included a year in South Africa with ReMix Dance Company, also projects in Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, and America. In Europe she has worked extensively in Switzerland.

Turvey World Dance collaborates with filmmakers, visual artists, musicians and dancers to draw on the expansive vocabulary generated by co-creation to develop intimate and immersive works.

Gerry’s work has been seen in a wide range of art galleries, using art works and exhibitions as a starting point for movement. She has developed work and projects at Huddersfield Art Gallery, Whitworth Manchester, Graves Sheffield, Leeds Art Gallery; Hepworth Wakefield, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Mcb-a Switzerland and Iziko National Gallery, South Africa.

> The way the dancers inhabited the space made me feel a part of the fabric of the performance. I haven't seen anything quite like that in an art gallery
