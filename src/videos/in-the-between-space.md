Gerry collaborated with artist Catherine Bertola, and film maker Andy Wood to create a piece at Temple Newsam House in a hidden tunnel underneath the courtyard. Three dancers animate this narrow, dark and now inactive space creating constant and repetitive movement to visualise the human labour, and show the rhythm and flow in the space. The soundtrack is constructed from recordings of the five working clocks in the collection.
