In collaboration with Dr Sabrina Rahman Exeter University and Christina Zutterland Sweden. Gerry lead a workshop in September 2021 for participants as part of a 3 day conference in Basel concerning re-mapping design history. The workshop was an embodied practice for the participants focusing on the body in physical space, and to the reflect on their relationship to objects and location. These ideas and practices are currently working towards further research at Lister Mill in Bradford. This will explore Diaspora by Design: Migration, Mills and Interiors.
