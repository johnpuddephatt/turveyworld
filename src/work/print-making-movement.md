To **Bring this Momentum**  is a collaboration with print maker and visual artist David Armes who was in residence at Hyde Park Arts Club (*part of Hyde Park Book Club)*. Gerry created a duet with dance artist Vanessa Grasse  which was a  live performance within the installation. Additionally there were movement and print workshops. 

These events will now be developed this year  2025 at a Gallery in Newark in early. More information to follow
