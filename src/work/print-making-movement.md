To Bring this Momentum  2024  is a collaboration with print maker and visual artist David Armes who was in residence at Hyde Park Arts Club (*part of Hyde Park Book Club)*. Gerry created a duet with dance artist Vanessa Grasse  as a  live performance within the installation. Additionally there were movement and print workshops. 

These events will be developed at a Gallery in Newark in early 2025. More information to follow
