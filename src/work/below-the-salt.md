As part of the 500 year anniversary at Temple Newsam House, Gerry collaborated with Artist Catherine Bertola. She created a film with three dancers in the underground passageways and hidden stairwells of the house to reflect how the servants would navigate unseen below the building.  The film was shown in Catherine's exhibition which was open to the public at the house. 

You can see the film now on the video page of this site
