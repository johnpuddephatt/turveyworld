As part of the 500 year anniversary at Temple Newsam House, Gerry will be collaborating with Artist Catherine Bertola. They will create a film with some dancers in the underground passageways and hidden stairwells of the house to reflect how the servants would navigate unseen below the building.  The film will be shown in Catherine's exhibition at the house from April  to Nov 2020.
