Below the Salt.

Gerry will be collaborating with Artist Catherine Bertola to create a film in the underground passageways at Temple Newsam House in early 2020. To re animate and reveal the hidden parts previously used by servants. The film will be shown as part of Catherine's exhibition in April 2020 which is part of the 500 year celebration at the house.
