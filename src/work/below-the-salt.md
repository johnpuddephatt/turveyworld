As part of the 500 year anniversary at Temple Newsam House, Gerry collaborated with Artist Catherine Bertola. She created a film with three dancers in the underground passageways and hidden stairwells of the house to reflect how the servants would navigate unseen below the building.  The film will be shown in Catherine's exhibition at the house from April  to Nov 2020. Exhibition was due to open on April 4th. It exhibition will now open later this year. You can see the film now on the video page of this site
