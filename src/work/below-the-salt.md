As part of the 500 year anniversary at Temple Newsam House, Gerry collaborated with Artist Catherine Bertola. She created a film with three dancers in the underground passageways and hidden stairwells of the house to reflect how the servants would navigate unseen below the building.  The film will be shown in Catherine's exhibition which is now open to the public at the house from Sept 2020 to Nov 2021.
