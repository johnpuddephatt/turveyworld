Following the success of the work they did together at Temple Newsam in 2020. (The Between Space) Gerry started a new project with Catherine Bertola in early 2022. This has created a film located at Seaton Delaval Hall in NE England. The work explores play with choreography and film in the daily spaces we inhabit. Performed by dancer Mati Torres Laborde, filmed and edited b Christo Wallers from Film Bee. The film work will be shown later this year, potentially at The baltic in Newcastle, and hopefully there will be some live performences by Mati in different spaces soon.
